# TerrorStrikeWeaponRandomizer
This program will randomize the weapons of the SAS and terrorists.

******************
***Installation***
******************
Copy the “TSRandomizer.exe” to the “system”
folder of your Terror Strike game directory.  This also works with
The Regiment version of the game so you will either copy it to:

Terror Strike\system

-or-

The Regiment\system

The randomizer needs to be in the system folder
along with “SASGame.u” and “SASChars.u” so it can modify
them.

*********
***Use***
*********
To use simply run the “TSRandomizer.exe”
program and close it out when it's done.  Then launch and play the
game as normal.  Each time you run the randomizer it will assign the
SAS troopers and the terrorists random weapons.  Some characters have
more random possibilities than others.  For example, a terrorist with
an Uzi can either have an Uzi or an M60, and likewise a terrorist
with an M60 can have either that or an Uzi.  These limitations are
due to the fact that this is a mod so not everything is possible. 
The majority of characters in the game can have numerous possible
weapons though.

********************
***Uninstallation***
********************
Simply delete “TSRandomizer.exe” and copy the
included default “SASGame.u” and “SASChars.u” files to your
Terror Strike / The Regiment system folder.
